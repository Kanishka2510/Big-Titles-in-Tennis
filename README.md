Visualization of this project is done in Power BI. So, if Power BI is not present, then Powerpoint file is provided to see the dashboard.
Excel file provided is the final data obtained after cleaning it and modifying it to present in usable form for visualization.
Raw data was large in size, so it is divided in two parts.
