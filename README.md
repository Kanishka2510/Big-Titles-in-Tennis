Visualization of this project is done in Power BI. So, if Power BI is not present, then Powerpoint file is provided to see the dashboard.
Excel file provided is the final data obtained after cleaning it and modifying it to present in usable form for visualization.
Big Titles in Tennis consists of Grand Slam, ATP Finals, Masters 1000 & Olympics. But, olympics data was not present to be used & it would not have made sense in this project, even if it was provided.
These data were first cleaned in Power Query in Excel, then Power BI was used for visualization.
Raw data was large in size, so it is divided in two parts.
